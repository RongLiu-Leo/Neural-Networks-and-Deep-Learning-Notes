# Neural Networks and Deep Learning notes
I surprisingly and occasionally found a free online book, Neural Networks and Deep Learning. This book is well-written and thoroughly illustrated and benefits me a lot so I note something here in response to my sudden inspiration in order to review conveniently in the future.

Incidentally, to readers and future me, this is my first attempt to word technical blogs so naive thoughts and incorrect representation inevitably appear. Please be patient and tolerant when reading.

This repository consists of six directories in correspondence to six chapters of the book. Similarly, each directory contains different note files consistent with sections. At the outset of section notes, some sparkle ideas and inspiration are recorded, and followed parts are the corresponding exercises.

Hope you enjoy my whim.
