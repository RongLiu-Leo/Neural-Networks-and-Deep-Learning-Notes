# Neural Networks and Deep Learning notes
Why this repository comes up is that I surprisingly and occasionally found a free online book, [*Neural Networks and Deep Learning*](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/). This book is well-written and thoroughly illustrated and benefits me a lot so I note something here in response to my sudden inspiration for convenience to share with you and review in the future.

Incidentally, to you and future me, this is my first attempt to word technical blogs so naive thoughts and incorrect representation inevitably appear. Please be patient and tolerant when reading.

This repository consists of six directories in correspondence to six chapters of the book. Similarly, each directory contains different note files consistent with sections. At the outset of section notes, some sparkle ideas and inspiration are recorded, and followed parts are the corresponding exercises.

*Notes are something novel or inspirational to me instead of simplification of the book. If you are willing to master overall and detailed knowledge, please refer to the link above directly.*

*If you cannot display mathematic equation correctly, please download [*MathJax*](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mathjax-plugin-for-github/ioemnmodlmafdkllaclgeombjnmnbima) plugin.*

**Technology comes and Technology goes, but insight is forever.** 
--one of my favorite sentences in the book

**Hope you enjoy my whim.**
