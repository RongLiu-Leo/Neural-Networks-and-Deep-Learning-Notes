# neural networks and deep learning notes
I ocassionally found a free online book, Neural Networks and Deep Learning. This book is well-written and thoroughly illustrated and benefits me a lot so I note something here in response to my sudden inspiration in order to review conviniently in the future.
Incidentlly, to readers and future me, this is my first attempt to word technical blogs so naive thoughts and incorrect representation inevitably appear. Please be patient and tolerant when reading.
Each dictory contains a chapter content shown in different sections. At the outset of section note, some sparkle ideas and inspiration are recored, and followed parts are the corresponding exercises.
